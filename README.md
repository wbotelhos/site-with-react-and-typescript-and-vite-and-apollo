# Site with React and TypeScript and Vite and Apollo

Using [React](https://react.dev) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) we'll consume a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) and build a simple site.

This site will have different pages so the [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) will be set in place and the entire project will be supported by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Setup

```sh
# clone the project
git clone git@github.com:wbotelhos/site-with-react-and-typescript-and-vite-and-apollo.git

# access the project
cd site-with-react-and-typescript-and-vite-and-apollo

# installs the dependencies
yarn install

# run the server
yarn dev

# open the browser
open localhost:5173
```
